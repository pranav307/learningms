    ####
    The error Uncaught TypeError: Illegal constructor 
    is happening because you're trying to use <Lock /> but never imported it, and Lock is 
    a reserved word in JavaScriptâ€”so it's trying to construct something invalid.

    ####
    if (purchase === course._id)
This compares an object (purchase) with a string (course._id).
 It will always return false, because courses (from useGetorderQuery) is likely
 an array of orders or an object containing course IDs, not a single string.
